# Learning different kind of Sorts

## Introduction 
Ways to sort stuffs are definitely an important fundamentals in computer science and it is often ignored by most of the programmers by just applying the native .sort function provided by the programming language that we are currently using. 

This is just a repo of self learning on sorts and further improve understanding on choosing the right algorithm based on different scenarios.

> The first use case to learn all sorts algorithm will be using the same data from testdata.json and implement all kind of sorts and compare the runtime of each sorts.

## Sorting algorithm includes:   
1. Insertion Sort :white_check_mark:
2. Bubble Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort
8. Bucket Sort
9. Counting Sort

## Goal of the repository
This repository will be my self-learning of all kind of sort algorithms and try to write a medium article to discuss these sorting algorithms and use case of applying them. :blush:
